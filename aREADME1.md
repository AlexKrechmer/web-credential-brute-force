💡 Learning Reflection
This project started as a simple credential brute-force tester. With AI assistance, I enhanced it by adding advanced features such as:

Color-coded output for better UX

Full logging with timestamps

Response handling for rate limiting (HTTP 429)

These additions improved both the tool's realism and my understanding of web application security and scripting techniques.
